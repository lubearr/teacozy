# Tea Cozy Project
## Overview
This is a project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path. This project required following a provided wireframe and creating a responsive single page using basic HTML and CSS. New concepts being practiced include CSS media queries and Flexbox.

## Project Prompt
> In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer. We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.
